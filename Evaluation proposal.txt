I will be comparing FPS during collisions of a variable amount of objects using mesh colliders, 
in both Unity and Unreal using VR,
to determine which is the best optimized for a physics-based VR game. 

For the test cases, there will be 3 sets of tests potentially with an additional set of tests if time and hardware allows.  
The tests will be using 3 different models, each using a mesh collider. 
These models used will be a cube, a sphere, and a complex mesh (monkey head), each made using Blender's own basic objects. 
I will specifically be using mesh colliders. No box colliders for the cubes, or sphere colliders for the spheres
This is for the sake of consistency, and for the purpose of testing the FPS using complex shapes, as these are more common in VR games than basic shapes.
If possible, I will conduct a fourth test mixing these models throughout the test

For the sample sizes I will be putting the objects equally spaced from each other, in a 3-dimensional grid. 
The sample sizes will be a 10x10x10 grid, a 20x20x20 grid, a 50x50x50 grid and, if hardware allows, a 100x100x100 grid. 

I will be measuring the FPS for these test cases and taking an average of them to put in the graphs. 
If there is a notable deviation (for example, if once all the objects have fallen and become static, and the FPS increases) then additional graphs may be made to show FPS over time.
